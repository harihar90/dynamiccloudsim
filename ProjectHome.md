### DynamicCloudSim: Simulating Heterogeneity in Computational Clouds ###

Performance instability commonly encountered in non-uniform and shared infrastructures like computational clouds has been repeatedly observed to strongly influence the runtime of applications. DynamicCloudSim extends the CloudSim simulation toolkit by introducing models for (1) inhomogeneity in the performance of computational resources, (2) uncertainty in and dynamic changes to the performance of virtual machines, and (3) straggler machines and failures during task execution.

Furthermore, DynamicCloudSim introduces a fine-grained representation of computational resources, thereby enabling the simulation of executing different kinds of applications (CPU-, I/O-, communication-bound) on machines with different performance characteristics. As an entry point for research on workflow scheduling, DynamicCloudSim provides the functionality to simulate the execution of scientific workflows using different well-established schedulers.
